# **A Strategic and Technical Guide to Off-Site Scrypted NVR Backups with Google Cloud**

## **Executive Summary**

This report provides a comprehensive strategy and implementation plan for creating a cost-effective, automated, 7-day rolling backup of a local Scrypted Network Video Recorder (NVR) system to Google Cloud. The analysis addresses the specific requirements of a 22-camera deployment producing 2K resolution video on a 24/7 basis, with a primary focus on financial transparency and technical robustness.

The proposed solution architecture deviates from simplistic file-synchronization methods, instead advocating for a custom, API-driven script that interfaces directly with the Scrypted Software Development Kit (SDK). This programmatic approach ensures data integrity and transactional reliability. The script will be designed to periodically query the Scrypted NVR for newly created video segments and upload them to a purpose-configured Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket.

Key findings from the analysis reveal that the most critical cost-control mechanism is not the selection of the cheapest storage tier, but rather the implementation of an automated 7-day deletion policy using Google Cloud's Object Lifecycle Management. Due to the short retention period, the GCS "Standard" storage class is identified as the only financially viable option, as it avoids the early deletion penalties associated with colder storage tiers. Furthermore, a detailed cost projection clarifies a common misconception: data transfer *into* Google Cloud (ingress) is free of charge, meaning the primary "transfer cost" for this backup operation is borne by the local Internet Service Provider's upload bandwidth, not Google Cloud's network fees.

This document serves as a complete roadmap, guiding the user from foundational data volume analysis and architectural design through to detailed script logic, cloud environment configuration, a comprehensive financial forecast, and final implementation steps.

## **Section 1: Foundational Data Analysis: Projecting Storage and Bandwidth Requirements**

To architect a viable and cost-effective backup solution, it is imperative to first establish a quantitative understanding of the data footprint. This section deconstructs the video stream parameters to model the total data volume and the corresponding network bandwidth required to transfer this data to the cloud. These calculations form the bedrock upon which all subsequent architectural decisions and cost projections are built.

### **1.1 Deconstructing 2K Video Bitrates for Surveillance**

The bitrate, or the amount of data used to encode one second of video, is the single most significant factor determining storage and bandwidth consumption. While various platforms provide recommendations, it is crucial to select a value appropriate for the specific use case of 24/7 security surveillance.

For context, a high-quality 2K (1440p) video upload to a platform like YouTube is recommended to have a bitrate of 16 Megabits per second (Mbps) for standard frame rates (24-30 frames per second).1 Other streaming guides suggest a broader range, from 6-13 Mbps up to 15-24 Mbps, depending on frame rate and content complexity.2 However, these figures are optimized for dynamic, high-motion content intended for public consumption.

Security footage, by contrast, is often characterized by long periods of low motion, interspersed with moments of activity. Modern video codecs (like H.264 or H.265/HEVC) are highly efficient at compressing static scenes. Therefore, using a high streaming bitrate for 24/7 recording is often unnecessary and financially imprudent. A lower, well-chosen bitrate can maintain sufficient detail for forensic review (e.g., identifying faces, license plates) while dramatically reducing the data load. For the purpose of this analysis, we will model three realistic bitrate scenarios—4 Mbps, 6 Mbps, and 8 Mbps per camera—to provide a clear spectrum of potential costs and requirements.

### **1.2 Data Volume Modeling: From Megabits per Second to Terabytes per Week**

With a defined range of bitrates, it is possible to calculate the precise data generation rate. The conversion from bits per second to bytes per hour is achieved with the following formula:

Data Rate (MB/hour)=8 bits/byteBitrate (Mbps)×(106 bits/Mb)​×106 bytes/MB3600 seconds/hour​  
This simplifies to:

Data Rate (MB/hour)=Bitrate (Mbps)×450  
Scaling this calculation for 22 cameras over a 24-hour period and a full 7-day retention window yields the total storage footprint. Equally important is the required sustained upload bandwidth, which is the aggregate bitrate of all cameras uploading simultaneously. The results of these calculations are presented in Table 1\.

The data presented in this table immediately highlights a critical consideration that precedes any cloud cost analysis: the local network's upload capacity. For example, to support the 6 Mbps scenario, a sustained, continuous upload speed of 132 Mbps is required. Most consumer and even prosumer internet plans are asymmetrical, offering significantly lower upload speeds than download speeds. Therefore, the first step in implementation must be to verify that the existing internet service plan can reliably provide the necessary upload bandwidth 24/7. If it cannot, the project is non-viable without a service upgrade, or the camera bitrates must be lowered. This reframes the initial challenge from a pure cloud problem to a holistic infrastructure assessment.

**Table 1: Estimated Daily and 7-Day Data Volume & Upload Bandwidth**

| Bitrate per Camera (Mbps) | Data per Camera per Day (GB) | Total Data per Day (GB) | Total 7-Day Storage Footprint (TB) | Required Sustained Upload Bandwidth (Mbps) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 4 | 43.20 | 950.40 | 6.65 | 88 |
| 6 | 64.80 | 1425.60 | 9.98 | 132 |
| 8 | 86.40 | 1900.80 | 13.31 | 176 |

## **Section 2: Solution Architecture: A Programmatic Approach to NVR Backup**

The architecture of the backup system dictates its reliability, scalability, and maintainability. This section outlines a high-level design that prioritizes a robust, API-driven workflow over simpler but more fragile file-level synchronization methods.

### **2.1 End-to-End Workflow Diagram**

The proposed solution follows a clear, automated data pipeline. The process can be visualized as a sequence of distinct steps:

1. **Local Scrypted NVR:** Continuously records 24/7 footage from all 22 cameras to its designated local storage. The NVR software is responsible for segmenting this continuous stream into manageable video files or clips.  
2. **Local Automation Server:** A machine on the local network (which could be the Scrypted server itself, if it has sufficient resources) runs a scheduled script.  
3. **Backup Script Execution:** At a regular interval (e.g., hourly), the script initiates.  
4. **Scrypted SDK/API Interaction:** The script makes a programmatic call to the Scrypted NVR's API, requesting a list of all video clips created since the last successful backup.  
5. **Video Data Retrieval:** For each new clip identified, the script requests the full video data (MediaObject) from the Scrypted NVR.  
6. **Google Cloud SDK Interaction:** The script then uses the Google Cloud SDK to establish a connection with Google Cloud Storage.  
7. **Data Upload:** The video data is streamed directly from the script's memory to the designated GCS bucket, creating a new object (file) in the cloud.  
8. **GCS Lifecycle Management:** Independently and automatically, Google Cloud Storage monitors the age of all objects in the bucket. When an object's age exceeds 7 days, the lifecycle policy triggers its deletion.

### **2.2 The Critical Choice: API-Driven Extraction vs. Direct Filesystem Access**

A common temptation for a task like this is to use a simple file synchronization tool like rsync.4 This approach, while seemingly straightforward, is fundamentally flawed for backing up a live application like an NVR and carries significant risks:

* **Data Corruption:** The NVR software manages its own database of recordings. Directly accessing and copying files from its storage pool while the NVR is actively writing to them can result in "torn writes," leading to corrupt, incomplete, or unplayable backup files.  
* **Lack of Transactional Integrity:** A file-level copy is not transactional. It is unaware of the NVR's internal state. An API call, by contrast, requests a specific, completed recording segment, ensuring that only whole and valid clips are backed up.  
* **Opacity of Storage Format:** The NVR may not store video in a simple, flat directory of .mp4 files. It could use a proprietary database, a complex directory structure, or a specific container format. Attempting to navigate this directly is fragile and likely to break with future Scrypted updates.  
* **Incompatibility with NVR Cleanup:** The Scrypted NVR has its own internal logic for managing local disk space, deleting the oldest recordings to make room for new ones. A rsync process running concurrently could fail if a file it is trying to copy is deleted by the NVR mid-transfer.

The professional and correct approach is to treat the Scrypted NVR as a service and interact with it through its formally defined Application Programming Interface (API).5 This method respects the application's boundaries, guarantees that only complete and valid data is retrieved, and provides a stable, forward-compatible integration point. The user's request for an "open-source script" naturally leads to this more sophisticated and reliable architecture; a simple file-copy script would be doomed to fail, whereas a script built upon the Scrypted SDK becomes a robust microservice for data extraction.

### **2.3 Adopting Cloud-Agnostic Design Principles**

While this report focuses on Google Cloud, it is prudent to design the solution with long-term flexibility in mind. Cloud-agnostic design is a software development practice that avoids dependencies on any single cloud provider's proprietary services, thereby preventing "vendor lock-in" and enabling portability.6

This principle can be applied to the backup script by architecting it in a modular fashion:

* **Extractor Module:** This part of the script will be responsible solely for communicating with the Scrypted API to fetch video clips. Its logic is entirely independent of the cloud destination.  
* **Uploader Module:** This module will receive video data from the Extractor and handle the specifics of uploading it to a cloud provider (in this case, Google Cloud Storage).

By separating these concerns, the core logic of Scrypted integration is preserved. If, in the future, a decision is made to switch to a different provider like Backblaze B2 or Amazon S3, only the Uploader module needs to be rewritten. This design choice represents a small upfront investment in code structure that pays significant dividends in future flexibility and cost optimization opportunities.

## **Section 3: Interfacing with Scrypted NVR: Programmatic Video Extraction**

To implement the API-driven architecture, a deep understanding of the Scrypted developer environment is necessary. Scrypted is a modern platform built primarily using TypeScript, and it exposes a comprehensive SDK for developers to create plugins and scripts.8 This SDK is the key to programmatically accessing NVR recordings in a structured and reliable manner.5

### **3.1 Navigating the Scrypted Developer SDK**

The Scrypted developer documentation provides a detailed reference for all the core components, device interfaces, and media-handling objects available to a script or plugin.9 This confirms that a programmatic solution is the intended method for advanced integrations. The backup script will leverage this SDK, and while it could be written in any language capable of making HTTP requests, using TypeScript/JavaScript is the most direct path as it allows for native use of the provided SDK libraries. Python is also a strong candidate due to its excellent Google Cloud client libraries and mature ecosystem.

### **3.2 The Key to Access: The VideoClips Interface**

A thorough review of the Scrypted developer reference reveals the central component for this task: the VideoClips interface.10 This interface provides the exact methods required to query and retrieve recorded video segments. The two most critical methods are:

* getVideoClips(options?): Promise\<VideoClip\>: This function queries the NVR and returns an array of VideoClip objects. The options parameter can be used to filter the results, most importantly by providing a start and end time. This allows the script to ask the NVR for a precise list of clips created within a specific time window.  
* getVideoClip(videoId): Promise\<MediaObject\>: Once the script has a list of VideoClip objects, it can iterate through them and use their unique IDs to call this function. This method retrieves the actual video data for a single clip, returning it as a MediaObject which contains the raw data stream and metadata.

The existence of these API endpoints is a significant architectural advantage. It confirms that Scrypted already handles the complex task of segmenting the 24/7 recordings into discrete, manageable chunks. The backup script does not need to capture a continuous stream and perform its own segmentation; instead, it can operate as a periodic batch job. This transactional, stateful approach—"give me all completed clips from the last hour"—is inherently more resilient to network interruptions and simpler to schedule and manage than a continuous stream-capture process.

### **3.3 Script Logic Blueprint (Pseudo-code)**

The following pseudo-code outlines the complete logic for the backup script, incorporating initialization, state management, the main processing loop, and error handling.

## **Section 4: Optimizing Google Cloud Storage for Surveillance Archives**

Configuring the cloud destination correctly is just as important as writing the backup script. This section provides a detailed guide to setting up Google Cloud Storage, with a focus on two critical decisions: selecting the appropriate storage class and implementing an automated deletion policy. These choices are paramount for controlling costs and ensuring the system operates as a true "sliding window" archive.

### **4.1 The Critical Decision: Storage Class Selection**

Google Cloud Storage offers a tiered system of storage classes, each with a different price point and performance profile, designed for different data access patterns.11 The main classes are:

* **Standard Storage:** For "hot" data that is frequently accessed. It has the highest storage cost but no retrieval fees.  
* **Nearline Storage:** For data accessed less than once a month. It has a lower storage cost but includes a 30-day minimum storage duration and a per-GB retrieval fee.  
* **Coldline Storage:** For data accessed less than once a year. It has an even lower storage cost, a 90-day minimum storage duration, and higher retrieval fees.  
* **Archive Storage:** The lowest-cost option for long-term archival. It has a 365-day minimum storage duration and the highest retrieval fees.

The user's requirement for a 7-day retention period creates a direct and irreconcilable conflict with the cost-saving features of the Nearline, Coldline, and Archive classes. If a file is deleted from Nearline storage before its 30-day minimum duration has passed, an "early deletion" fee is charged.13 This fee is equivalent to the cost of storing that object for the remainder of the minimum duration. For a 7-day rolling backup,

*every single file* would be deleted "early," incurring penalties that would make these supposedly cheaper tiers vastly more expensive than Standard storage.

Therefore, the only financially and operationally sound choice for this workload is **GCS Standard Storage**. Despite its higher per-gigabyte monthly cost, its lack of a minimum storage duration and absence of retrieval fees makes it perfectly suited for a short-term, high-churn, rolling archive. This is a counter-intuitive but crucial decision point: the path to cost optimization lies not in choosing the cheapest-at-a-glance storage class, but in choosing the class that aligns with the data lifecycle.

### **4.2 Automating the Sliding Window: Object Lifecycle Management**

The most powerful cost-control mechanism in this entire architecture is Google Cloud's Object Lifecycle Management feature. This tool allows for the creation of automated, policy-based rules that act on objects within a bucket without any manual intervention or custom scripting.13 For this project, it will be used to enforce the 7-day sliding window.

The implementation involves creating a simple but powerful rule on the GCS bucket:

* **Action:** Delete  
* **Condition:** Age is greater than 7 days.

When this rule is in place, Google Cloud's systems will automatically and continuously scan the bucket. Any object whose creation timestamp is more than 7 days in the past will be permanently deleted. This "set and forget" configuration perfectly implements the user's core requirement and prevents storage costs from growing uncontrollably.

A lifecycle configuration can be set up through the Google Cloud Console or defined programmatically in a JSON file and applied using the command-line interface. The JSON representation of the required rule would be:

JSON

{  
  "lifecycle": {  
    "rule":  
  }  
}

This configuration is the financial linchpin of the solution. It ensures that the storage costs remain stable and predictable, directly proportional to the 7-day data volume calculated in Section 1, and no more.

## **Section 5: The Complete Backup & Synchronization Script**

This section synthesizes the preceding analysis into a more detailed script blueprint and provides practical guidance on its automation and management.

### **5.1 Full Script Pseudo-Code (Annotated)**

            break \# Stop this run to avoid getting out of order

    \# Save the new state  
    save\_state(latest\_successful\_timestamp)

### **5.2 Automation and Scheduling with cron**

To fully automate the backup process, the script must be executed on a regular schedule. On Linux-based systems, which are common for hosting Scrypted, the standard utility for this is cron. A crontab entry can be configured to run the script at a desired interval.

An hourly execution is a sensible starting point. It provides a good balance between minimizing potential data loss (at most, one hour of footage) and reducing the load on the Scrypted server and network from frequent script executions.

An example crontab entry to run the script at the top of every hour would be:

Bash

\# Edit the crontab file by running 'crontab \-e'  
\# Add the following line:  
0 \* \* \* \* /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/scrypted\_backup.py \>\> /var/log/scrypted\_backup.log 2\>&1

This command executes the script, and crucially, it redirects all output (both standard output and standard error) to a log file. This logging is essential for troubleshooting and verifying that the backups are running correctly over time.

### **5.3 Essential Tooling: gsutil for Management and Verification**

While the script automates the upload process, it is important to have tools for manual verification, management, and potential disaster recovery. The gsutil command-line tool, which is part of the Google Cloud CLI, is the primary utility for interacting with GCS from a terminal.

Essential commands for managing the backup bucket include:

* List objects: To see the files currently in the bucket.  
  gsutil ls gs://your-scrypted-backup-bucket/  
* Check storage usage: To get a human-readable summary of the total data size.  
  gsutil du \-h gs://your-scrypted-backup-bucket/  
* Download a file (manual restore): To retrieve a specific video clip from the cloud back to the local machine.  
  gsutil cp gs://your-scrypted-backup-bucket/camera-name/video-file.mp4.  
* View lifecycle configuration: To verify that the 7-day deletion policy is active.  
  gsutil lifecycle get gs://your-scrypted-backup-bucket/

Familiarity with these commands provides the necessary tools to audit the backup system's health and perform manual restores if required.

## **Section 6: Comprehensive Financial Analysis and Cost Projection**

A transparent and accurate financial forecast is critical for a project of this scale. This section breaks down the Google Cloud billing model into its constituent parts, calculates the expected costs for each, and presents a final, consolidated monthly projection.

### **6.1 Deconstructing the Google Cloud Bill: The Three Cost Vectors**

The total monthly cost for this solution will be the sum of three distinct components 16:

1. **Data Storage:** The cost of physically storing the data in Google's data centers. This is billed per gigabyte-month.  
2. **Network Usage (Egress):** The cost of transferring data *out* of Google Cloud's network.  
3. **Operations:** The cost associated with API requests made to the storage service, such as writing (uploading), reading, or listing objects.

### **6.2 Storage Cost Calculation**

This is the primary cost driver. The calculation is straightforward: the total 7-day storage footprint (from Table 1\) is multiplied by the monthly price for GCS Standard storage. In most US regions, this price is approximately $0.020 to $0.023 per GB per month.18 For this projection, an average price of $0.022 per GB/month will be used.

For the 6 Mbps scenario, the 7-day storage footprint is 9.98 TB.

* Total GB: 9.98 TB×1024 GB/TB=10219.52 GB  
* Monthly Storage Cost: 10219.52 GB×$0.022/GB/month=$224.83

### **6.3 Clarifying "Transfer Costs": Ingress vs. Egress**

This is the most commonly misunderstood aspect of cloud pricing. The user's query expressed concern over "transfer costs," but it is vital to distinguish between data moving in and data moving out.

* **Ingress:** Data transfer *into* Google Cloud from the internet. For nearly all services, including Cloud Storage, ingress is **free**.17  
* **Egress:** Data transfer *out of* Google Cloud to the internet. This is what incurs network charges, typically ranging from $0.08 to $0.12 per GB in North America.21

The primary operation of this backup solution—uploading video from the local NVR to GCS—is 100% ingress. Therefore, the Google Cloud network cost for the daily backup operation is zero. Egress costs would only be incurred in a disaster recovery scenario where footage needs to be downloaded from GCS. The user's actual, recurring "transfer cost" is the monthly bill for their high-speed ISP upload bandwidth.

### **6.4 Operations Cost Estimation**

Every file upload constitutes a "Class A" operation in GCS. For Standard storage, these operations are priced at approximately $0.0100 per 1,000 requests.19 Assuming the NVR segments video into one-hour chunks per camera, the number of daily uploads can be estimated:

* Uploads per day: 22 cameras×24 hours/day=528 uploads  
* Uploads per month (30 days): 528×30=15,840 uploads  
* Monthly Operations Cost: (15,840/1000)×$0.0100=$0.16

As the calculation shows, the operations costs for this workload are marginal and will have a negligible impact on the total monthly bill.

### **6.5 Table 2: Projected Monthly Google Cloud Costs**

This table synthesizes the above calculations, providing a clear financial forecast for each of the bitrate scenarios defined in Section 1\. It represents the total expected monthly charge from Google Cloud, excluding any one-time egress costs for data recovery.

**Table 2: Projected Monthly Google Cloud Costs**

| Bitrate Scenario | 7-Day Storage (TB) | Monthly Storage Cost | Monthly Operations Cost | Total Estimated Monthly Cost | Estimated Annual Cost |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 4 Mbps per Camera | 6.65 | $151.05 | $0.16 | **$151.21** | $1,814.52 |
| 6 Mbps per Camera | 9.98 | $224.83 | $0.16 | **$224.99** | $2,699.88 |
| 8 Mbps per Camera | 13.31 | $300.86 | $0.16 | **$301.02** | $3,612.24 |

## **Section 7: Strategic Alternatives and Performance Considerations**

A comprehensive analysis requires an examination of viable alternatives and potential system limitations. This section explores a leading alternative cloud storage provider known for its competitive pricing and discusses potential performance bottlenecks in the proposed architecture.

### **7.1 Alternative Cloud Provider: Backblaze B2**

While Google Cloud offers a robust and feature-rich platform, other providers specialize in low-cost bulk storage. Backblaze B2 is a prominent competitor with a significantly simpler and often more affordable pricing model for storage-heavy workloads.23

Key features of Backblaze B2's pricing include:

* **Storage Cost:** Approximately $6 per TB per month, which is substantially lower than GCS Standard's effective rate of \~$22 per TB per month.  
* **Egress Cost:** Free for up to three times the amount of data stored per month. For example, with 10 TB of stored data, up to 30 TB of data can be downloaded each month at no cost. This is a major advantage for disaster recovery scenarios.  
* **API:** B2 provides an S3-compatible API, meaning the "Uploader" module of the cloud-agnostic script designed in Section 2 could be adapted with relative ease to target B2 instead of GCS.

The table below provides a high-level comparison, highlighting the potential cost advantages of Backblaze B2 for this specific use case. This comparison underscores the value of the modular, cloud-agnostic script design, which would allow for a future migration to a more cost-effective platform without a complete rewrite of the core Scrypted integration.

**Table 3: High-Level Cost Comparison: GCS Standard vs. Backblaze B2**

| Cost Component | Google Cloud Storage (Standard) | Backblaze B2 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Monthly Storage Cost (per TB) | \~$22.50 | $6.00 |
| Egress Cost (per GB) | $0.08 \- $0.12 (after free tier) | Free (up to 3x stored data/month) |
| Class A Operations (Uploads) | \~$0.01 per 1,000 | Free |
| **Est. Monthly Cost (9.98 TB)** | **\~$225** | **\~$60** |

### **7.2 Identifying System Bottlenecks**

Beyond cloud costs, it is important to consider the performance limitations of the local infrastructure.

* **Local Server Performance:** The backup script, while not intensely CPU-bound, will consume memory, I/O, and network resources on the machine where it runs. If this machine is also the Scrypted NVR server, it is crucial to monitor its system load (CPU utilization, memory pressure, disk I/O wait times) during the script's execution. If the backup process negatively impacts the NVR's primary function of recording video, the script should be moved to a separate, dedicated machine on the local network.  
* **ISP Upload Bandwidth:** As identified in Section 1, this remains the most probable bottleneck. The calculations in Table 1 represent a *sustained average*. Real-world internet performance can fluctuate. It is essential to ensure that the ISP plan's advertised upload speed is consistently achievable and significantly higher than the required sustained bandwidth to accommodate overhead and fluctuations. A bandwidth monitoring tool should be used to confirm that the connection is not saturated by the backup process.

## **Section 8: Final Recommendations and Implementation Roadmap**

This final section synthesizes the entire analysis into a concise strategic recommendation and provides a clear, actionable checklist to guide the implementation process from start to finish.

### **8.1 Executive Summary of Strategy**

The recommended strategy is to implement an automated, off-site backup system using a custom API-driven script. This script, preferably written in Python or TypeScript, will programmatically interface with the Scrypted NVR via its SDK to retrieve completed video clips. These clips will be uploaded to a Google Cloud Storage bucket configured with the **Standard** storage class. The primary cost control and data management mechanism will be a non-negotiable **7-day deletion Object Lifecycle Management policy** configured directly on the GCS bucket. The entire process will be automated by scheduling the script to run hourly via a cron job.

### **8.2 Final Cost Outlook**

Based on the detailed financial analysis, the most realistic forecast should be based on the 6 Mbps per-camera bitrate scenario. This provides a good balance of video quality and data volume. The definitive projected monthly cost for this scenario, covering all Google Cloud charges for a 7-day rolling backup of 22 2K cameras, is approximately **$225**. This translates to an annual cost of roughly **$2,700**. This figure is stable and predictable, assuming the number of cameras and their settings remain constant.

### **8.3 Actionable Implementation Checklist**

The following checklist provides a step-by-step roadmap for executing this project:

1. **Pre-flight Check: Verify ISP Bandwidth:** Before incurring any costs, use a reliable speed testing tool over a 24-hour period to confirm that the sustained ISP upload bandwidth consistently exceeds the requirement calculated in Table 1 for the desired bitrate.  
2. **Google Cloud Project Setup:** Create a new Google Cloud account (if one does not exist) and create a dedicated project for this backup solution.  
3. **Create GCS Bucket:** Within the new project, create a new Google Cloud Storage bucket. Choose a region that is geographically appropriate and cost-effective.  
4. **Configure Lifecycle Policy:** Immediately navigate to the bucket's "Lifecycle" tab and create a new rule. Set the action to "Delete" and the condition to an object "Age" of 7 days. This is the most critical cost-control step.  
5. **Create Service Account:** In the "IAM & Admin" section of the Google Cloud Console, create a new service account. Grant this account the "Storage Object Creator" and "Storage Object Admin" roles for the newly created bucket. Create and download a JSON key file for this service account; this file contains the credentials the script will use.  
6. **Develop and Deploy Backup Script:** Using the blueprint provided in this report, develop the backup script. Install it on a suitable local server (either the Scrypted machine or a dedicated one) and configure it with the Scrypted credentials and the path to the downloaded GCS service account key.  
7. **Initial Manual Test:** Execute the script manually from the command line. Monitor its output and use the gsutil tool to verify that video files appear in the GCS bucket as expected.  
8. **Automate with cron:** Once the script is confirmed to be working correctly, create a cron job to schedule its execution at the top of every hour, ensuring its output is logged to a file for future auditing.  
9. **Monitor and Verify:** For the first few weeks of operation, regularly monitor the system. Check the cron log file for errors, monitor the local server's performance, and review the Google Cloud billing dashboard to ensure that costs are aligning with the projections in this report.
